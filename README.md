# Leaflet Challenge: Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet.js

## Overview
This project utilizes the [Leaflet Javascript library](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive web-based visualization of earthquake data. The data is obtained from the [United States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) (USGS), which is a primary source for information on natural hazards, environmental health, and the effects of climate and land-use changes. The project focuses on displaying [real-time earthquake data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) for earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or greater over the past 30 days. You can access the visualization tool [here](https://mattlantin.github.io/leaflet-challenge/)
